      - title: How do I add a device?
      content: "You have two options for adding a new device into LibreNMS.<br />

               1. Using the command line via ssh you can add a new device by changing to the directory of your LibreNMS install and typing (be sure to put the correct details).<br /><br />
                  <code>./addhost.php <hostname> [community] [v1|v2c] [port] [udp|udp6|tcp|tcp6]</code><br /><br />

               2. Using the web interface, go to Devices and then Add Device. Enter the details required for the device that you want to add and then click 'Add Host'."

      - title: Why do I get blank pages sometimes in the WebUI?
      content: "<p>The first thing to do is to add /debug=yes/ to the end of the URI (I.e /devices/debug=yes/).</p>

               <p>If the page you are trying to load has a substantial amount of data in it then it could be that the php memory limit needs to be increased in php.ini and then your web service reloaded.</p>"

      - title: How do I add support for a new OS?
      content: "<p>The easiest way to show you how to do that is to link to an existing pull request that has been merged in on <a href='https://github.com/librenms/librenms/pull/352/files' target='blank'>GitHub</a></p>

               <p>To go into a bit more detail, the following are usually needed:</p>

               <dl>
                   <dt>includes/definitions.inc.php</dt>
                   <dd>Update this file to include the required definitions for the new OS.</dd>
                   <dt>includes/discovery/os/ciscowlc.inc.php</dt>
                   <dd>This file just sets the $os variable, done by checking the sysDescr snmp value for a particular value that matches the OS you are adding.</dd>
                   <dt>includes/polling/os/ciscowlc.inc.php</dt>
                   <dd>This file will usually set the variables for $version and $hardware gained from an snmp lookup.</dd>
                   <dt>html/images/os/$os.png</dt>
                   <dd>This is a 32x32 png format image of the OS you are adding support for.</dd>
               </dl>"
